# DSA_Coding_Implementations 🚀

## 📘 About This Repository
This repository contains my **custom implementations** of **data structures and algorithms (DSA)** in **Java**, following a structured learning approach inspired by:
- **Introduction to Algorithms (4th Edition) – Cormen, Leiserson, Rivest, Stein (CLRS)**
- **My course syllabus on Algorithm Design and Analysis**

Each algorithm and data structure is implemented **from scratch**, with explanations of its **time complexity**, **use cases**, and **optimizations**.

## 📌 Why I Built This
As a student passionate about **problem-solving and algorithmic thinking**, I wanted to:
- **Code each algorithm from scratch** to deeply understand its mechanics.
- **Apply theoretical concepts** (from CLRS and my course) in **real Java implementations**.
- **Analyze time complexity** under different conditions (Best/Average/Worst).
- **Experiment with optimizations** (e.g., Early Exit in Bubble Sort, Tail Recursion in DP).

This repository **documents my learning journey**, including **breakdowns, optimizations, and challenges faced**.

## 🛠 Languages & Tools
- **Programming Language**: Java
- **IDE**: IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code
- **Reference Books**:
  - *Introduction to Algorithms, Fourth Edition (CLRS)*
  - *Algorithm Design Manual – Steven Skiena*

## ✅ Goals Moving Forward
🔹 **Complete full implementations of all algorithms in Java**  
🔹 **Write test cases to validate correctness and efficiency**  
🔹 **Optimize algorithms for better space and time complexity**  
🔹 **Expand into more advanced topics (Graph Theory, DP, Machine Learning)**
